ES6 Promises are a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Promises provide a way to deal with asynchronous code in a more structured and readable manner, avoiding the so-called "callback hell." They simplify the process of working with asynchronous operations by allowing developers to chain and handle the results or errors of those operations.
